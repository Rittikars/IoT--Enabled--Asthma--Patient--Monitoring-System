# IoT--Enabled--Asthma--Patient--Monitoring-System
<div><b>Description:</b></div>
<div>
This project intends to design a cost-effective Internet of Things (IoT)-based remote asthma monitoring system to monitor patient health and interior environmental characteristics. Nodemcu, and Arduino microcontrollers assess heart rate, oxygen, temperature, humidity, air quality using MAX30100, DS18B20, DHT11, Dust Sensor, MQ-135. ThingSpeak and Blynk help to monitor patient samples via laptop and mobile devices respectively. Patient data were stored in spreadsheets. Doctors and patients received SMS and email alerts for high oxygen and body temperature. Statistical analyses were also done for the betterment of asthmatics. This study helps asthma sufferers evaluate and control their health by interpreting and displaying sensor data.

  <b>Our study is divided into two sections:</b>
  </div>
  <div>
<b>1.	Health Parameter:</b> Body temperature, Heart rate and oxygen saturation level.
    </div>
<div><b>Sensors</b>: DS18B20, MAX-3100.</div>
  
  <div>
<b>2.	Environmental Parameter:</b> Indoor temperature, Humidity, Air quality level and Presence of harmful gases.
  </div>
  <div>
<b>Sensors:</b> DHT-11, GP2Y1010- Dust sensor, MQ-135.
  </div>
  
 <div> 
  <b> To control these sensors, two microcontrollers are required.</b>
  </div>
  <div>
  <b>1.</b>	ESP8266-nodemcu
  </div>
  <div>
<b>2.</b>	Arduino Uno 
  </div>
